This is a study meant to validate the "motivation" and "efficacy" scales we developed by examining their relationships with self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption. The "motivation" and "efficacy" scales measure people's motivation to incorporate fruits and vegetables in their diets and their belief that incorporating fruits and vegetables into their diets will be efficacious for improving their health.

Fruit and vegetable consumption will be measured using a 30-item Food Frequency Questionnaire and 2-item FV intake questionnaire.

## Efficacy scale

* e01 "People who regularly eat fruits and vegetables rarely get sick."
* e02 "People who don’t eat the recommended amount and variety of fruits and vegetables are increasing their risk of serious diseases like heart disease and cancer."
* e03 "Eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables can make you feel better in a very short period of time."
* e04 "People who have health problems as they age could have prevented those problems by eating more fruits and vegetables when they were younger."
* e05 "You can’t ever feel your best if you’re not eating fruits and vegetables regularly."
* e06r "Whether you eat well or not won’t make much difference if your genetics predispose you to be unhealthy."
* e07r "As you get older, you are likely to develop health problems regardless of how you eat."
* e08 “If someone was going to make just one change to their lifestyle to improve their health, either eating more fruits and vegetables, getting more sleep, exercising more, or drinking less alcohol, they should eat more fruits and vegetables.”

## Motivation scale

* m01 "If the price of produce increased, I’d cut back on spending elsewhere so I could still purchase the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables."
* m02 "To me it would be worth spending an extra 15 minutes on preparation to incorporate more vegetables into a meal."
* m03 "I’m willing to drive a good deal out of my way to the grocery store if it means having a better selection of fresh produce."
* m04 "I plan to learn new cooking techniques so that I can make vegetables tastier."
* m05 "I’m willing to take time each week to plan and be strategic about my shopping so I can always have fruits and vegetables on hand, whether they be fresh or frozen."
* m06 "I’m going to plan my meals and shopping so that I am eating a vegetable-based meal like a salad for several meals each week.”
* m07r "I know I should eat more fruits and vegetables but I don’t feel very motivated to do so."
