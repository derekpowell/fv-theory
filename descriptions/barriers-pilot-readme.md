# Barriers Scale Pilot

__Date:__ _February 12, 2019_  
__Qualtrics Name:__ "nutrition barriers pilot"  

This is a pilot study conducted to test a new scale measuring barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption. The idea is that accounting for these barriers may reveal a stronger relationship between motivation and efficacy beliefs and FV consumption. If this suggestion is validated, it would further validate those scales as meaningfully connected to FV consumption. Further, to the extent that an intervention affects responses on these scales, we can conclude it is affecting beliefs that are meaningfully related to FV consumption.

Presented 30-item Food Frequency Questionnaire and 2-item FV intake questionnaire.

## Barriers scale (new)

* b01 "Cooking or preparing fruits and vegetables takes more time and energy than I can often spend."
* b02r "Financially, I have no problems affording a variety of fruits and vegetables."
* b03 "Fruits and vegetables are too expensive to purchase regularly."
* b04 "When I purchase fruits and vegetables, I find they often go bad too quickly to be eaten."
* b05r "I enjoy the taste of most vegetables."
* b06 "Where I live, it can be hard to find fruit that is in season and tastes good."
* b07r "My family members like to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables."
* b08 "I worry about the pesticides used on fruits and vegetables sold in most stores."
* b09 "I eat many of my meals out at places that do not typically serve many fruits or vegetables."
* b10 "My need for convenient foods sometimes limits my food choices."
* b11 "I'm often disappointed when I purchase fruit because it doesn't end up being ripe or flavorful."
* b12r "Flavorful and high-quality fruits and vegetables are readily available where I live, even in the winter."

## Efficacy scale

* e01 "People who regularly eat fruits and vegetables rarely get sick."
* e02 "People who don’t eat the recommended amount and variety of fruits and vegetables are increasing their risk of serious diseases like heart disease and cancer."
* e03 "Eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables can make you feel better in a very short period of time."
* e04 "People who have health problems as they age could have prevented those problems by eating more fruits and vegetables when they were younger."
* e05 "You can’t ever feel your best if you’re not eating fruits and vegetables regularly."
* e06r "Whether you eat well or not won’t make much difference if your genetics predispose you to be unhealthy."
* e07r "As you get older, you are likely to develop health problems regardless of how you eat."
* e08 “If someone was going to make just one change to their lifestyle to improve their health, either eating more fruits and vegetables, getting more sleep, exercising more, or drinking less alcohol, they should eat more fruits and vegetables.”

## Motivation scale

* m01 "If the price of produce increased, I’d cut back on spending elsewhere so I could still purchase the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables."
* m02 "To me it would be worth spending an extra 15 minutes on preparation to incorporate more vegetables into a meal."
* m03 "I’m willing to drive a good deal out of my way to the grocery store if it means having a better selection of fresh produce."
* m04 "I plan to learn new cooking techniques so that I can make vegetables tastier."
* m05 "I’m willing to take time each week to plan and be strategic about my shopping so I can always have fruits and vegetables on hand, whether they be fresh or frozen."
* m06 "I’m going to plan my meals and shopping so that I am eating a vegetable-based meal like a salad for several meals each week.”
* m07r "I know I should eat more fruits and vegetables but I don’t feel very motivated to do so."
* m08 "If I’m ordering pizza I’m going to make an effort to make it healthier by adding vegetable toppings like mushrooms, onions, or peppers."
