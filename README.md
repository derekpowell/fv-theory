# Encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption through intuitive theory building
_Authors:_ Derek Powell & Ellen Markman

This repo is dedicated to what will likely be a series of studies examining the role of intuitive theories in motivating fruit and vegetable consumption. We are specifically interested in how educational interventions aimed at building richer intuitive theories, specifically by providing mechanistic and teleological understanding, can increase motivation to eat healthily.

## Past work

We have already conducted nearly a dozen studies examining these issues. Many of these studies were aimed at testing the effects of an intervention we developed, and comparing it with existing educational material taken from the USDA's [MyPlate](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/) education campaign. Overall, the results of these studies were somewhat equivocal. There was generally good evidence for modest increases in motivations to eat fruits and vegetables following our intervention, and some evidence for greater increases from our intervention as compared to MyPlate materials. An issue that plagued this work was the difficulty of developing valid and effective measurement scales while simultaneously examining the effects of interventions.

## Present studies

The present (and future) studies in this project are aimed at taking a more methodical approach to first identify an effective and validated set of measurements and then to test the effects of various interventions on those measures.

The overall plan of the project is to:

1. Construct scales to measure beliefs in the efficacy of fruits and vegetables for improving health and motivation to include FVs in diet
2. Validate these beliefs predict real FV consumption
3. Test effects of intuitive theory-building interventions on these beliefs

Along the way we are also interested in measuring the sophistication of people's intuitive theories, and their degree of understanding for the material contained in the interventions.

Studies to be reported here examining the relationships between different beliefs and FV consumption can be considered exploratory. Once an effective set of measures is developed, confirmatory work will examine the effects of educational interventions on these relevant belief measures.

## Project structure

I'm trying to be more organized.

* descriptions: markdown files describing the materials, purposes, and procedures for each pilot study
* data: anonymized data files
* code: rmarkdown notebooks containing analyses

### Notes

Computational Reproducibility: R version 3.5.2, requires `tidyverse` packages.

Analyses should run in Docker container `derekpowell/rstudio-bayesreg`.
